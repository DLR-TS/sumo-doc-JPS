Warning: Program '0' at tlLogic '7628244053' is incompatible with logic at junction '7628244053' (mutual conflict between link indices 2,11 tl indices 10,9 phase 5).
  To avoid deadlock/collisions, either: rebuild the signal plan with a newer version of netconvert/netedit
  or rebuild the network with option '--tls.ignore-internal-junction-jam' or include the program when building.
